## Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that gives you a way to pass requests along a chain of potential handlers until an object handles it or the end of the chain is reached. It consists of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains a reference to the next processing object in the chain.

#### Benefits:

Decoupling: It decouples sender and receiver objects.
Dynamic linking: New handlers can be added without changing the existing code.
Ease of Organization: It simplifies your object because it doesn't need to know the chain's structure and keeps the request within the chain.


Let's break down the implementation of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in a Spring Boot application into clear steps:


**1. Set Up Your Spring Boot Project:**
- If you haven't already, create a Spring Boot project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) or your preferred IDE. Ensure you have the `Spring Web` dependency to create web applications.

**2. Define the Handler Interface:**

```java
public interface ValidationHandler {
    Data handle(final Request request, final List<BigDecimal> prices, final int jur, final boolean auto, final String uuid);
}
```

**3. Implement Individual Handlers as Spring Components:**
- Create concrete classes that implement the `ValidationHandler` interface.
- Annotate each handler with `@Component` to make them Spring-managed beans.

```java
@Component
public class NoBetItemsHandler implements ValidationHandler {
    @Override
    public Data handle(final Request request, final List<BigDecimal> prices, final int jur, final boolean auto, final String uuid) {
        // Implementation...
        return null;  // or appropriate result
    }
}

// Implement other handlers in a similar fashion.
```

**4. Inject All Handlers into the Main Processor:**
- Use Spring's autowiring feature to inject a list of all handler beans into the main processor.
- Implement the logic that iterates through each handler in the list.

```java
@Component
public class Processor {
    private final List<ValidationHandler> handlers;

    @Autowired
    public Processor(List<ValidationHandler> handlers) {
        this.handlers = handlers;
    }

    public Data create(final Request request, List<BigDecimal> prices, int jur, boolean auto, String uuid) {
        for (ValidationHandler handler : handlers) {
            final Data result = handler.handle(request, prices, jur, auto, uuid);
            if (result != null) {
                return result;
            }
        }
        return defaultResponse();
    }
}
```

**5. (Optional) Control Handler Order:**
- If you need to control the order in which handlers are processed, annotate your handler components with `@Order`. Lower values have higher priority.

```java
@Order(1)
@Component
public class NoItemsHandler implements ValidationHandler { /*...*/ }

@Order(2)
@Component
public class NullHandler implements ValidationHandler { /*...*/ }
```

**6. Implement Your Service or Controller:**
- Create a Spring REST controller (or service).
- Autowire the main processor (`Processor`) into the controller.
- Use the processor to handle incoming requests.

```java
@RestController
public class Controller {

    @Autowired
    private Processor processor;

    @PostMapping("/create")
    public ResponseEntity<Data> create(@RequestBody Request request) {
        final Data result = processor.create(request, "");  // additional parameters
        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
    }
}
```

**7. Run Your Spring Boot Application:**
- Start your application (typically via the main class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`).
- Your Chain of Responsibility setup is now active, and incoming requests to the `/create` endpoint will be processed through the chain of handlers.

This completes the setup of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in a Spring Boot application. You now have a dynamic and flexible way to process requests through a sequence of validation and processing steps.
